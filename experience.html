            As the Student Associate of the UT Library System, I directed the preparations of the numerous meetings
            that would take place throughout the day. I also resolved inquiries that visitors to the library or corporate
            connections many have. Through this experience, I was able to improve my communication and listening skills.

            <br>
            As an intern, I completed four projects that mainly focused on using Microsoft Excel, the BI tool, Phocas, and Sugar CRM.
            These projects allowed me to interact with co-workers in different branches and improved my understanding of the branches'
            interrelation. My experience in China enabled me to adapt to the company work style quickly.

            Having studied Chinese for three years, this experience allowed me to improve my cultural understanding of China.
            The greatest difficulty was adapting to the difference in company hierarchy between Chinese companies and American companies.
            Working at both reception and international trade branches allowed me to understand the responsibilities of each position.

            Entering college, because of my prior studies in Japanese, the Japanese professor offered me a Japanese Teacher's Assistant position.
            I mainly assisted the professor in correcting 65 student's mistakes and answering any questions they may have on the assignment or the lecture.
            The student's questions pushed me to improve my communication to allow me the clear any misunderstanding and explain the Japanese language
            more thoroughly.

            Upon returning from Tsinghua University, I was selected as the Financial Director for The Austin Meal Movement.
            In this position, I organized a tabling event during Valentine, increasing the org budget by over $200. Furthermore, I budgeted the
            expenses for the following semester to reduce the chance of the other branches overspending on events.

            Because of my interest in data analysis, I hoped to improve my proficiency in data manipulation. Through this opportunity,
            I was able to create a visualization for the muscle motion and vibration. It is also a great experience to reach out to
            the athletes from different sports at UT Austin to scout for subjects to participate in the experiment.

            As the Restaurant Industry Analyst in the Financial branch, I reached out to invited local restaurant owners to attend
            our meetings as presenters. These presenters would hold workshops at our meeting, presenting about owning a restaurant, and
            teaching us new skills. Furthermore, I communicated with other branches to organize events to raise funds for TAMM. Through this,
            the budget for the next semester was increased by 5%.

            As a freshman, it was nerve-wracking to join a committee to plan one of the most significant ABSA events of the year.
            We decided to invite more speakers to attend our event because the number of committee members was increased.
            Through event advertising and activities for members, we increased student involvement by 15%.
